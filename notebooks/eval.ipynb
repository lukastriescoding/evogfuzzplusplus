    "As mentioned before the **EvoGFuzz** paper took a very simple approach for calculating the fitness of each input. The paper itself suggested three different functions that might improve the outcome for future work. A ```naive```, an ```improved``` and a ```sophisticated``` approach. \n",

    "# 4 Solution Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Standard Fitness Function** is a binary function that assigns the value of 1 if an exception is found and 0 otherwise. It does not reward more interesting and complex exception types. In\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "fitness(x) = score_{feedback}(x) + score_{structure}(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The feedback score is 0 if no exception is triggered. If an exception is triggered we set the feedback score to an integer value depending on the structure score of each fitness function so that an exception triggering input has more weight. The goal is to maximize the fitness score.\n",
    "First we are going to implement the fitness functions as mentioned in Eberlein’s bachelor thesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```naive``` approach simply takes in the length of the input. To reward a failing input, we add 100 to the score. We implement this in the ```naive_fitness_function```.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ```improved``` approach we count the expansions of the derivation tree, square it and devide it by the length of the input and multiply the length by a paramater $\\lambda$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of ranking inputs just because of their length, the improved fitness function counts the number of expansions. The hope is that with more expansions used more uncommon exceptions will be found. \n",
    "Because we want to reward long inputs that were produced by many expansions instead of inputs that just produce long words, we set the number of expansions in relation to the length of the input.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We reward failing inputs as before. This is implemented in the ```improved_fitness_function```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```sophisticated``` approach rewards more complex expansions. For that we also need the degree of each node, which is then exponantiated by the height of it. As the fitness scores tends to get quite large, we need to reward failing inputs by adding $2^{100}$ to it. We want expansions that have a high fan out and appear deep inside the derivation tree.\n",

    "The ground structure of EvoGFuzz stays the same. There are only two parts of the EvoGFuzz implementation that we changed. One is the ***’fuzz()’*** function, which now returns the bugs found after each iteration. This is important as we need that data for ***RQ2***. We also amended the ’fitness function’ module with our five new fitness functions. To implement them one needs to import the intended function from said module and set the given parameter when instantiating a new EvoGFuzz instance.\n",
    "We created the ***’eval’*** directory, where our script for the evaluation is placed. To start the evaluation, one can change the parameters in the main function. Possible changes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of trials\n",
    "- Grammar on which the evaluation operates\n",
    "- Initial inputs that belong to the grammar\n",
    "- Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "To call the logic, the **eval.py** needs to be executed. It produces an output file, that contains the results. To differentiate multiple output files, the program takes an argument, which will be concatenated to the file-name. The call **python eval.py calc\\_grammer\\_1** will produce the output-file *\"resultscalc\\_grammar\\_1.txt\"*. This file contains a bunch of lists containing the results. Each list entry represents a trial and each list contains all the trials for one iteration. The file contains all the results for all of the fitness functions which are seperated by a new line each."
